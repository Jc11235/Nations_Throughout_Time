Update 12/22/2015

#Pre-alpha v 0.0.04

#Added
-The game now supports a "wrap-around" map, meaning the player can cycle around the world and end up where they started.

-The game now has coastal waters, which are different from ocean only by image for now.

-Misc code cleanup, mostly corresponding to additions to the terrain.

#Bug Fixes
-Terrain visibility no longer fails to become "true" if you discover new areas.

#Known bugs
-Cites and city borders will occasionally disappear, a rescroll of the map will cause it to reappear.
