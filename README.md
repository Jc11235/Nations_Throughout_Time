#Bug Fixes
-Fixed an issue where units would not spawn on the city they were created in.

#Known bugs
-During world setup, the settler and scout can spawn on water, or just outside of the map.

-Unit movement costs only take into account the tile they went to, not the path it took to get there.

-When a unit spawns on a city, clicking on the unit does not retain it's focus, you must hold the mouse button down.
